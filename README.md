# NFT Data Analysis

NFT Data Analysis is a personal project where I perform data analysis on various NFT projects and marketplaces on the Ethereum blockchain. The objective of this project is to extract valuable insights and showcase my findings through data analysis.

# Features

This repository will gradually be updated with code that can be used to perform NFT data analysis. The scripts provided will be basic outlines that can be customized by tweaking certain parameters. This way, the analysis will already have a solid foundation, and I can easily modify the code to perform the analysis as I choose.

# The following features will be included:

-Pulling data from various NFT collections and marketplaces

-Extracting insights and patterns in NFT sales and trading

-Presenting findings through easy-to-understand charts and reports

-Customizing scripts to meet specific needs

More to be added as and when
